                    <div class="faq-content">
                        Selecting the right mattress depends on your sleeping position, body type, and personal comfort preferences. For instance, side sleepers may benefit from a softer mattress that cushions pressure points, while back sleepers might prefer a firmer surface for spinal alignment. Consulting with our sleep specialists can help you find the perfect match for your needs.

However, if you have known allergies, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare professional before making a purchase.
